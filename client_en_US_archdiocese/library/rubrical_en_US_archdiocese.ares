ru.HierarchicalKairosAtLauds = "The Archbishop takes “kairo” in preparation for the Divine Liturgy, as the right choir slowly sings “Ton Despotin…” When he is finished, the Archbishop blesses the people with the candles, as the left choir sings “Eis polla eti, despota,” and he enters the altar. Then the choirs resume singing Lauds."
