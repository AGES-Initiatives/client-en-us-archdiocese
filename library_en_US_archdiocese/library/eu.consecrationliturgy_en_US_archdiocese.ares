Through the Holy Spirit they became mighty in word and deed, they delivered to us the Baptism of adoption, they built Churches, they established holy Altars, and they instituted canons and laws. And we sinners, now in possession of this tradition, come before You, the eternal God and implore You, O compassionate Lord: As this sanctuary was erected for the purpose of singing hymns of praise to You, fill it with Your divine glory, and make the holy Altar set up herein to be a Holy of Holies, so that when we stand before it, as before the dread Throne of Your kingdom, we may serve You without condemnation, and may send up petitions for ourselves and for all Your people, and offer the bloodless sacrifice to Your goodness, for the forgiveness of sins both voluntary and involuntary, for the governing of our life, to lead a good life, and to fulfill all righteousness."
